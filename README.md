# Pusher + Twitter - Naughty or Nice

A bit of fun to see if those that are tweeting about Christmas are being **Naughty or Nice**. This app uses [Pusher][pusher], the [Twitter Streaming API](https://dev.twitter.com/streaming/overview, [D3.js][d3],  [Twemoji][twemoji] and is inspired by a demo originally created by [@girlie_mac](https://twitter.com/girlie_mac).
